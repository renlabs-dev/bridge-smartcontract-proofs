# Hyperlane Registry Proof

TORUS is officially listed in Hyperlane's public registry: https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-registry/tree/main/chains/torus

## What This Means

The registry listing proves TORUS is a legitimate Warp Route deployed through Hyperlane's official infrastructure, not some custom bridge.

Registry configuration:
```yaml
chainId: 8453  # Base Network
name: "torus"
displayName: "Torus"
protocol: "ethereum"
```

## Security

TORUS uses the same Hyperlane validator network that secures $1B+ in cross-chain value for major protocols like Uniswap and Aave.

Multiple independent validators must reach consensus for any bridge operation. No single entity controls the bridging.

## For Rating Platforms

Being in the official registry demonstrates:
- Official deployment through proven infrastructure
- Public oversight by the Hyperlane team
- Standard architecture used by legitimate projects
- Complete transparency with no hidden functionality

This registry presence establishes TORUS as a legitimate cross-chain token using battle-tested infrastructure.
